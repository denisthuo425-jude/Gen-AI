# JacLang Assignment: Day of the Week Calculator

This folder contains a JacLang assignment for Gen-AI training.

## File Overview
- `day_of_week.jac`: JacLang code that calculates the day of the week for a given date using Zeller's congruence.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have JacLang installed.
2. Run the assignment with:
   ```bash
   jac ASSIGNMENT/day_of_week.jac
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter a date (year, month, day).
4. The program will output the corresponding day of the week.

## Purpose
This is a simple JacLang assignment for practicing date calculation logic and Jac syntax. It is **not** an AI system. The code does not use machine learning, LLMs, or any AI modelâ€”it is a deterministic algorithm based on mathematical rules.

## Notes
- For Gen-AI training, this assignment demonstrates basic JacLang abilities and walker logic.
- If you want to build AI features (e.g., LLM integration), see other files in the main repo such as `guess_game6.jac`.
